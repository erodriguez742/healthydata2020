                            Population health is a concept at the core of national
healthcare reform efforts. Population health focuses on the social
determinants of health, or the living conditions of people at work,
home, and play. To participate in population health initiatives,
organizations must collect population-level data, creating a
discourse of resilience-as-ability-to-cope through mapping
community demographics, as though a counting of bodies and
their material conditions creates a foundation for sustained,
improved health outcomes. In 2010, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion (ODPHP) launched an initiative called Healthy
People 2020, a set of ten-year national goals and objectives for
health promotion and disease prevention. We analyze this data
project, arguing that discourses of resiliency (through improved
national, state, and local data collection efforts) and vulnerability
(of the people who are reduced to data) create a constitutive
rhetoric for U.S. public health officials to rally around the cause of
population health yet exclude the very people upon whom such a
cause should focus. Specifically, an examination of the ODPHP’s
Healthy People 2020 website reveals that the reduction of bodies
to quantification in data displays for health professionals, when
viewed through the lens of Philip Wander’s Third Persona,
objectifies groups of people already historically marginalized and
obfuscates pathways to social action. We argue that instead, an
ecological, relational definition of resilience must be fostered
through autonomy of communities in the decisions they make
about their own community members’ health and wellness.

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
The link between people’s health and their surroundings [the social determinants of health] can no longer be ignored. Health inequities continue to grow across social classes, occupations, and ethnic groups within countries, even where more resources are made available and in spite of applying ‘the best’ evidence- based interventions. (WHO, 2006, n.p.)</p>

                    <p>Health professionals are increasingly aware that moving beyond the clinical to the socio-cultural is critical. To address the social determinants of health, population health—or health strategies at the population rather than individual level—are at the core of American healthcare reform efforts. Moving from a clinical care focus to a population health focus is challenging, particularly because clinical concepts of health are better understood and not aligned well with community resources (Flores, qtd. in Alper & Institute of Medicine, 2014, p. 7). The Affordable Care Act includes several incentives to healthcare organizations to address these challenges.</p>
<p>To participate in population health initiatives, organizations must collect population-level data and track success of targeted population-level interventions. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) launched an initiative called Healthy People 2020, a set of ten-year national goals and objectives for health promotion and disease prevention. The “social determinants of health” are included as a “new topic area” in these objectives (HHS, 2010, n.p.). The Healthy People initiative provides numerical targets for healthcare organizations, state and local governments, and nonprofits to strive to improve population-level data as it relates to the social determinants of health. The ODPHP then collects this data.</p>
<p>In this essay, we analyze this data project, arguing that in Healthy People 2020 the discourses of resiliency (through improved national, state, and local data collection efforts) and vulnerability (of the people who are reduced to data) create a constitutiverhetoric for U.S. public health officials to rally around the cause of population health yet exclude the very people upon whom such a cause should focus. Specifically, an examination of the ODPHP’s Healthy People 2020 website reveals that the reduction of bodies to quantification in data displays for health professionals, when viewed through the lens of Philip Wander’s Third Persona, objectifies groups of people already historically marginalized and obfuscates pathways to social action. We begin by reviewing how rhetorics of resiliency and vulnerability have been constructed in population health discourse more broadly, and then narrow in on the rhetorical construction of these terms in the context of the Healthy People 2020 data project. We discuss the Healthy People 2020 web-based content in light of this construction and end by offering recommendations for re-design of information for this space that creates agency rather than disempowers communities to improve health and wellness at the population level.</p>

                    <h4>The Discourses of Resiliency and Vulnerability in Population Health</h4>
                    <p>Resilience in the face of public health risk (broadly construed, from environmental risks such as climate change to sociocultural risks such as mass gun violence) is often rhetorically constructed in opposition to vulnerability to that risk. Bridie McGreavy has studied the discursive construction of resilience from environmental risk as a human-centered capacity for coping (2016, p. 105). Vulnerability is affectability to risk, meaning those who are vulnerable are likely to be swayed or to bend in the face of risk. In discourses of resilience and vulnerability, a resistance to affectability reduces vulnerability, thereby creating strength. That strength, or ability to cope, is resilience. This definition is widely adopted in public health discourses and also evident in our particular public health example, ODPHP’s Healthy People 2020.</p>
                   <p>In the last twenty years, a shift in focus has occurred in public health to focus on population health, a concept and a set of policies that include both the traditional notion of managing risk of emergent, catastrophic public health disaster, as well as health promotion, or day-to-day prevention of disease in the population through focus on non-medical factors, including social, cultural, and environmental causes of poor health. It is important to note that the interest in population health versus public health is driven both by the healthcare industry and government, as the burden of resource allocation to pay for care for patients who are uninsured or underinsured is closely tied to the interest in population health management (Béland & Katapally, 2018, p. 369). The “vulnerable” under population health, then, must be managed in such a way to prevent expense for healthcare payers and organizations. As a trade journal for managed care networks reported, “The number of patients with chronic conditions [a key vulnerable group] is expected to rise by 37% within the next 24 years, placing significant strain on existing healthcare systems, particularly as the condition of this population is exacerbated by existing social and economic risk factors” (AJMC, 2006, n.p.). Vulnerability, then, is part and parcel with cost to the American healthcare system. A resilient patient stays healthy (and out of the hospital or clinic).</p>
                    <p>Who are the vulnerable under population health? In At Risk in America: The Health and Health Care Needs of Vulnerable Populations in the United States, Lu Ann Aday (2001) offers a data- driven framework of the vulnerable, with cross-cutting demographic issues (age, gender, race/ethnicity, income and education) as well as population-specific categories, including: high-risk mothers and infants, chronically ill and disabled people, persons living with HIV/AIDS, mentally ill and disabled people, alcohol or substance abusers, suicide or homicide prone people, abusing families, homeless persons, and immigrants and refugees. Numerous charts and data sets locate and enumerate individuals within these categories.</p>
                    <p>Despite Aday’s categorization and framing of vulnerability, she ultimately comes to a more ecological viewpoint of resilience and vulnerability, arguing, like McGreavy, for the reframing of discourses of resilience and vulnerability from human-centered to policy-focused solutions involving the larger ecologies humans inhabit. Unlike those within the medical-industrial complex such as payers and hospitals, Aday recommends much broader interventions than the biomedical, looking at economic and social supports for families, communities, and institutions that are relational and focused on “reciprocity, interdependence, and the common good” (2001, p. 264). A focus on relations is profoundly rhetorical and combats individualistic notions of resilience. It also reveals the connections between communities and the healthcare system that are not readily apparent. In describing the inherent shortcomings of focusing on human agency, Nathan Stormer and Bridie McGreavy (2017) argue that the ecology of relationships entangles over abilities of individuals within these systems. Rather, by focusing on the relational, they argue that capacity and systemic adaptability (rather than human agency) are indicative of a community’s ability to be resilient, while a focus on an individual’s abilities merely signifies vulnerability. Stormer and McGreavy’s ecological re-conception of resilience is more in line with relational policies that shift the focus toward all human and non-human actors’ interdependence and alleviate the burden from only those deemed unable to cope. As Philippa Spoel and Colleen Derkatch (2019) also argue, this definition should replace resilience as “self- reliance” or “ability to cope” in order to truly work toward collective community improvement.</p>
                    <p>Categorization of vulnerable populations under a population health paradigm causes a belief that these identities are fixed and capable of being identified through big data approaches and then acted upon to improve the capabilities of individuals within these categories. As Michel Foucault famously argued in Security, Territory, Population, the very concept of population as a mechanism for social control by the nation-state has potentially harmful effects (2007). As in many other areas of scientific and medical study, the discourses of resiliency and vulnerability are constructed in population health around a belief in the power of techno-scientific solutions for problems that are socio-cultural. This belief can be harmful in the context of large-scale environmental issues, McGreavy argues, because “focusing on simple fixes masks the ideologies, inequities, and other complex factors that may also need to be addressed” (McGreavy, 2016, p. 114). The Healthy People 2020 data project we turn to next is exactly this kind of techno-scientific solution.</p>
