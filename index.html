                            Population health is a concept at the core of national
healthcare reform efforts. Population health focuses on the social
determinants of health, or the living conditions of people at work,
home, and play. To participate in population health initiatives,
organizations must collect population-level data, creating a
discourse of resilience-as-ability-to-cope through mapping
community demographics, as though a counting of bodies and
their material conditions creates a foundation for sustained,
improved health outcomes. In 2010, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion (ODPHP) launched an initiative called Healthy
People 2020, a set of ten-year national goals and objectives for
health promotion and disease prevention. We analyze this data
project, arguing that discourses of resiliency (through improved
national, state, and local data collection efforts) and vulnerability
(of the people who are reduced to data) create a constitutive
rhetoric for U.S. public health officials to rally around the cause of
population health yet exclude the very people upon whom such a
cause should focus. Specifically, an examination of the ODPHP’s
Healthy People 2020 website reveals that the reduction of bodies
to quantification in data displays for health professionals, when
viewed through the lens of Philip Wander’s Third Persona,
objectifies groups of people already historically marginalized and
obfuscates pathways to social action. We argue that instead, an
ecological, relational definition of resilience must be fostered
through autonomy of communities in the decisions they make
about their own community members’ health and wellness.

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
The link between people’s health and their surroundings [the social determinants of health] can no longer be ignored. Health inequities continue to grow across social classes, occupations, and ethnic groups within countries, even where more resources are made available and in spite of applying ‘the best’ evidence- based interventions. (WHO, 2006, n.p.)</p>

                    <p>Health professionals are increasingly aware that moving beyond the clinical to the socio-cultural is critical. To address the social determinants of health, population health—or health strategies at the population rather than individual level—are at the core of American healthcare reform efforts. Moving from a clinical care focus to a population health focus is challenging, particularly because clinical concepts of health are better understood and not aligned well with community resources (Flores, qtd. in Alper & Institute of Medicine, 2014, p. 7). The Affordable Care Act includes several incentives to healthcare organizations to address these challenges.</p>
<p>To participate in population health initiatives, organizations must collect population-level data and track success of targeted population-level interventions. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) launched an initiative called Healthy People 2020, a set of ten-year national goals and objectives for health promotion and disease prevention. The “social determinants of health” are included as a “new topic area” in these objectives (HHS, 2010, n.p.). The Healthy People initiative provides numerical targets for healthcare organizations, state and local governments, and nonprofits to strive to improve population-level data as it relates to the social determinants of health. The ODPHP then collects this data.</p>
<p>In this essay, we analyze this data project, arguing that in Healthy People 2020 the discourses of resiliency (through improved national, state, and local data collection efforts) and vulnerability (of the people who are reduced to data) create a constitutiverhetoric for U.S. public health officials to rally around the cause of population health yet exclude the very people upon whom such a cause should focus. Specifically, an examination of the ODPHP’s Healthy People 2020 website reveals that the reduction of bodies to quantification in data displays for health professionals, when viewed through the lens of Philip Wander’s Third Persona, objectifies groups of people already historically marginalized and obfuscates pathways to social action. We begin by reviewing how rhetorics of resiliency and vulnerability have been constructed in population health discourse more broadly, and then narrow in on the rhetorical construction of these terms in the context of the Healthy People 2020 data project. We discuss the Healthy People 2020 web-based content in light of this construction and end by offering recommendations for re-design of information for this space that creates agency rather than disempowers communities to improve health and wellness at the population level.</p>

                    <h4>The Discourses of Resiliency and Vulnerability in Population Health</h4>
                    <p>Resilience in the face of public health risk (broadly construed, from environmental risks such as climate change to sociocultural risks such as mass gun violence) is often rhetorically constructed in opposition to vulnerability to that risk. Bridie McGreavy has studied the discursive construction of resilience from environmental risk as a human-centered capacity for coping (2016, p. 105). Vulnerability is affectability to risk, meaning those who are vulnerable are likely to be swayed or to bend in the face of risk. In discourses of resilience and vulnerability, a resistance to affectability reduces vulnerability, thereby creating strength. That strength, or ability to cope, is resilience. This definition is widely adopted in public health discourses and also evident in our particular public health example, ODPHP’s Healthy People 2020.</p>
